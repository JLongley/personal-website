Hi, I'm Jimmy, a software developer in Seattle with a passion for reading, learning, and all things web.

This is my playful one-page portfolio featuring Parallax effects and animations. Built by extending the Gatsby Theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-cara`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara).
