## About

I am a developer at [Consensus](https://Consensus.app), an AI-powered academic search engine dedicated to democratizing access to scientific knowledge.

Previously, I led the engineering team at [BookNook](https://www.booknooklearning.com/), working to provide equitable literacy education through high-dose tutoring for children.

I get inspired by finding ways that technology can help people become better learners.

I've designed Amazon delivery drones, traveled the world backpacking, and worked on [Developer Atlas](https://www.DeveloperAtlas.com/), a free online resource to guide aspiring programmers toward becoming professional software developers.
