## About

Until recently, I led the engineering team at [BookNook](https://www.booknooklearning.com/), working to help kids gain equal access to literacy education through high dosage tutoring.

Before that, I filled my time designing Amazon delivery drones, backpacking around the world, and working on [Developer Atlas](https://DeveloperAtlas.com), a free online knowledge base designed to help new programmers figure out how to become professional software developers.

I'm currently seeking my next role.
