## About

I lead the engineering team at [BookNook](https://booknooklearning.com), where we're trying to help kids get equal access to literacy education through high dosage tutoring.

Before that, I filled my time designing Amazon delivery drones, backpacking around the world, and working on [Developer Atlas](https://DeveloperAtlas.com), a free online knowledge base designed to help new programmers figure out how to become professional software developers.
